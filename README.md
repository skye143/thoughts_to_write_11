## [Description](#table-of-contents)

As part of this project, I was assigned to develop an application named "Note Taker" that facilitates the creation, deletion, and storage of notes. The application is designed with an Express.js back end that enables users to generate and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

While the front end of the application has already been developed, my responsibility was to build the back end and establish a seamless connection between the two. Ultimately, I will be deploying the finished application to Heroku for final deployment.
